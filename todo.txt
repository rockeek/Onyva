Now Club registration is like:
{
   "identifier":"aaabbb",
   "clubs":[
	     {
	        "clubId":"10000",
	        "password":"FirstDummy"
	     },
	     {
	        "name":"newClub",
	        "password":"FirstDummy"
	     }
	]
}

 Then Remy is unlinked with Xsara
  And Remy is linked to Opel
  
#Case 6b
Given Remy is in Xsara car
  And Opel car has no more free seats
 When Remy moves from Xsara to Opel
 Then Remy is unlinked with Xsara
  And Remy is linked to Sidewalk
  And A message says the Opel car had no more seats


2/4/17 - Too many Clubs can be created with that request. This would create 2 new clubs.
The same identifier should not be able to create new clubs too quickly!
This should be avoided too:

POST /club

[
   {
      "identifier":"aaabbb"
   },
   {
      "clubs":[
         {
            "name":"newClub",
            "password":"FirstDummy"
         },
         {
            "name":"newClub",
            "password":"FirstDummy"
         }
      ]
   }
]
